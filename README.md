# Welcome to #BlowMeAFly repository
A public repository to conduct the analysis and graphs from "Dispersal capacity regulates early arrival during ecological succession", by Colares et al. (2023). 
Here, we provide tha data and R code to reproduce our analysis.

# Data outline
In this repository, you will find:
- Landmark data that represent the shape of (A) wing (wingFixed2.TPS), (B) dorsal view of the thorax (toraxdorsalFixed2.TPS), and (C) lateral view of the thorax (toraxlateralFixed2.TPS) of 355 individuals of carrion Blowflies, distributed across 11 species.

- Abundance data from 44 samples (rat carcasses) across space and time (in 4 spatial samples collected throughout the whole decomposition process of rats; Blow_Occ.csv). Also, you will find data of nine functional traits: (i) wing shape; (ii) thorax shape in dorsal view; (iii) thorax shape in lateral view; (iv) wing size; (v) thorax size in dorsal view; (vi) thorax area in lateral view; (vii) thorax volume; (viii) thorax volume/wing size ratio; and (ix) thorax height. Finally, you will find the environmental data corresponding to each sample as measures of temperature, precipitation and seasons (specimenID.csv).

- An R code (BlowflyAnalysis_Jan2023.R) to reproduce our morphological and statistical analysis of traits and the graphs presented in the main paper and supporting information.
